# Systems
Have three vital attributes:
    * Population
    * Resources
    * Fuel

Population is required to man infrastructure and recruit armies.
Resources are required to build infrastructure and build bases/ships.
Fuel is required to move fleets around.

Each of these contribute points to the faction.

Infrastructure is a multiplier on the three attributes. Each point of infrastructure
is divided by some base. This then scales the points.

Economy is volitile. It grows slowly over time if there are no disruptions.
But a drop in stability will lower the economy. And the economy can never
grow beyond stability. Each point of economy is multiplied by each pop, res and
fuel point to get the taxes.

Stability represents the safety of the population. It lowers the economy.

Loyalty is 0 to 100. As loyalty drops it is more likely for events to occur
which lower stability, infrastructure or destroy facilities.
